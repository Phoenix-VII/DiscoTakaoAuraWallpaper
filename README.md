installs in C:\Program Files\ASUS\Aura Wallpaper Service\Wallpaper

To get it to actually work, you need to flat out replace the files inside of one of the folders without renaming the folder or touching the config files.

I don't know why or what causes it, but if you don't do exactly that, Aura Wallpaper will flat out not recognize any aura wallpapers installed.
